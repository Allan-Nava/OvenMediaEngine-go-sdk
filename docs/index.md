# Oven Media Engine Go SDK Official Documentation

### What is OvenMediaEngine?
OvenMediaEngine (OME) is a Sub-Second Latency Live Streaming Server with Large-Scale and High-Definition. With OME, you can create platforms/services/systems that transmit high-definition video to hundreds-thousand viewers with sub-second latency and be scalable, depending on the number of concurrent viewers.
OvenMediaEngine can receive a video/audio, video, or audio source from encoders and cameras such as OvenLiveKit, OBS, XSplit, and more, to WebRTC, SRT, RTMP, MPEG-2 TS, and RTSP as Input. Then, OME transmits this source using LLHLS (Low Latency HLS) and WebRTC as output. Also, we provide OvenPlayer, an Open-Source and JavaScript-based WebRTC/LLHLS Player for OvenMediaEngine.
Our goal is to make it easier for you to build a stable broadcasting/streaming service with sub-second latency.
